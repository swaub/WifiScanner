## Technical Details

### Architecture
The application is built using a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **main.c** - Main application logic, GUI management, and event handling
2. **wifi_scanner.c** - Wi-Fi scanning engine using Windows WLAN API
3. **gui_components.c** - Custom GUI components and modern styling

### Dependencies
- **Windows 10/11** - Required for WLAN API support
- **Visual Studio 2022** - For building the project
- **Windows SDK** - For Win32 API access

### API Usage
- **Windows WLAN API** - For Wi-Fi network discovery and management
- **Win32 GDI** - For custom drawing and graphics
- **Common Controls** - For tree view and status bar components

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
1. **Visual Studio 2022** with C++ development tools
2. **Windows 10 SDK** (10.0 or later)
3. **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Build Steps
1. Open `WifiScanner.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Select your target configuration (Debug/Release)
3. Choose your platform (x86/x64)
4. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

### Build Configurations
- **Debug (x86/x64)** - For development and debugging
- **Release (x86/x64)** - Optimized for production use

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Application
1. Launch `WifiScanner.exe`
2. The application will automatically start scanning for networks
3. Networks will appear in the tree view sorted by signal strength
4. The signal graph updates in real-time showing the strongest networks

### Interface Elements
- **Tree View (Left)** - Expandable list of detected networks with details
- **Signal Graph (Right)** - Visual representation of network signal strengths
- **Refresh Button** - Manual network scan trigger
- **Export Button** - Save results to CSV file
- **Status Bar (Bottom)** - Scan progress and network count

### Network Information
Each detected network displays:
- **SSID** - Network name (or "Hidden" for hidden networks)
- **Signal Strength** - dBm reading with quality assessment
- **BSSID** - MAC address of the access point
- **Security** - Encryption protocol (Open, WEP, WPA2, WPA3, etc.)
- **Channel** - Wi-Fi channel and frequency
- **Connection Status** - Shows if currently connected

### Export Features
- Click "Export Results" to save scan data
- Choose file location and name
- Data saved in CSV format for analysis in Excel or other tools
- Includes all detected network information with timestamps

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10 (1903 or later)
- **RAM**: 256 MB
- **Storage**: 50 MB free space
- **Wi-Fi**: Built-in or USB Wi-Fi adapter

### Recommended Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **RAM**: 512 MB
- **Storage**: 100 MB free space
- **Display**: 1920x1080 or higher resolution

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **No data transmission** - All scanning is performed locally
- **No network connection** - Application only reads Wi-Fi information
- **No password storage** - Security protocols detected but not passwords
- **Local file access only** - Export files saved to user-selected locations

### Permissions Required
- **Wi-Fi access** - Required for network scanning
- **File system access** - Only for export functionality
- **No administrative rights** - Runs with standard user permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No networks detected**
   - Ensure Wi-Fi adapter is enabled
   - Check Windows Wi-Fi service is running
   - Verify adapter drivers are installed

2. **Application won't start**
   - Install Visual C++ Redistributable
   - Check Windows version compatibility
   - Run as administrator if needed

3. **Export fails**
   - Check file permissions in target directory
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Verify antivirus is not blocking file creation

### Performance Tips
- **Close other Wi-Fi tools** - Prevents scanning conflicts
- **Update Wi-Fi drivers** - Ensures best compatibility
- **Regular Windows updates** - Keeps WLAN API current
